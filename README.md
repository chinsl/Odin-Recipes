# odin-recipes

This is a project to practice basic html skills: how to create a file with boilerplate, metadata, headings, paragraphs, relative file links, image links, and lists (order and unordered). 

This project also involved exercising best practices for git, particularly adding proper commit messages. A remote github repository was also created and pushed.
